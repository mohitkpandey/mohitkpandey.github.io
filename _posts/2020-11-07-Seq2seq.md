I explore Seq2Seq model in Pytorch to build a neural machine translation system. <span style="color:red">**Currently the system translates from German to English.**</span> 
In this series, I will explore 
various state-of-the-art NLP architectures to build NMT systems algorithms and hope to focus on English to Hindi translation. 
I will also attempt to provide simplified mathematical explanations of the models as well as implementation details.

First on this list is Sequence-to-Sequence model using encoder-decoder paradigm. Check the <b>DEMO</b> below.

  function sendData()

      let request = new XMLHttpRequest();
      url = "http://127.0.0.1:8008/predict/"+document.getElementById('src').value
      request.open("GET", url);
      request.send();
      request.onload = () => {
        console.log(request);
        if (request.status === 200) {
          // by default the response comes in the string format, we need to parse the data into JSON
          document.getElementById('trg').value= request.response;//JSON.parse(request.responseText));
        } else {
          console.log(`error ${request.status} ${request.statusText}`);
        }

<!-- Much has been written lately about the increasing militarization of US
law enforcement. One of the most visible indicators of this shift in
recent decades is the increased frequency of tactical gear and equipment
worn and carried by police officers. However, this pales in comparison
to images of police departments bringing armored vehicles to peaceful
protests.  People often criticize police departments or SWAT
teams for owning and deploying tanks in situations that don’t warrant
their use. In reality, these ‘tanks’ are typically [Mine-Resistant
Ambush Protected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRAP) (MRAP) vehicles.
MRAPs were developed by the US military and produced by various
manufacturers from 2007-2009. As their name suggests, they are designed
to protect passengers from an improvised explosive device (IED) attack.

Given the extreme threat they were designed to survive, MRAPs are
emblematic of increasing police militarization in the US. But how did
police come to own these military-grade vehicles?

# Where have all the MRAPs gone?

Police departments, sheriff’s offices, and even school districts (the LA
Unified School District [briefly owned an
MRAP](https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/lausd-keys-mrap-tank/) in 2014
before [returning it to the Department of
Defense](https://www.dailynews.com/2014/11/21/lausd-school-police-return-armored-military-vehicle-which-is-now-in-barstow/))
