Welcome! I am an interdisciplinary researcher with skills and experience in machine learning, radiomics, social media text analytics, and natural language processing. I specialize in deep learning for bioinformatics. 

My work is published in interdisciplinary science journals like Plos One and cardiac imaging journals (Euporean Heart Journal, JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging etc), My research explores methods to automate prognosis and diagnosis of diseases using deep learning tools. While I primarily focus on applied machine learning, I am also interested in delving further into theories governing statistical machine learning.
